# Crop-Recommendation

I have done initial analysis using basic visualizations and then created a crop recommendation ML model

The model described in the provided code is a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel. Here's a brief description of the model:

Model Type: Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier

Kernel Type: Linear kernel

Input Features: The model takes three input features: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels, which are common nutrients in soil crucial for plant growth.

Target Variable: The target variable is the label of the crop, representing the type of crop recommended based on the input nutrient levels.

Training Data: The model is trained using a dataset containing information about different crops along with their recommended levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

Preprocessing: Before training the model, the input features are scaled using a StandardScaler to ensure that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This preprocessing step helps to standardize the range of the input features and improve the performance of the SVM classifier.

Training Process: The SVM classifier is trained on the scaled training data. During training, the classifier learns to classify crops based on their nutrient levels, with the goal of maximizing the margin between different classes.

Evaluation: After training, the model's performance is evaluated using accuracy as the evaluation metric. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances among all instances in the testing dataset.

Recommendation Function: The trained model includes a function recommend_crop that takes input values of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels and recommends a crop based on the trained classifier's predictions. The input nutrient levels are scaled using the same StandardScaler used during training before making predictions.

Example Usage: The model can be used to recommend a crop based on given input nutrient levels. For example, after training and evaluation, the recommend_crop function can be used to recommend a crop to farmers based on their soil's nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels.
